# OpenGLCppWrapper-data

This repo contains free textures, models and resources used in my examples for my project
https://github.com/Lecrapouille/OpenGLCppWrapper I prefer to separate git repos to avoid
to increase the download size of the repo holding code source.

See Credits.md for more information.
